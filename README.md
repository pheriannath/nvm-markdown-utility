# NVM Markdown Utility

In the main textarea, start typing whatever you would like. You'll see a rough preview in the right column.

When satisfied, press the "Convert" button to convert your Markdown to a single line, appropriate for usage in the Instructions (or description). From there, either copy the contents of the text box manually, or press the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

Finally, press the "Reset" button to start over.
